I will then give you the perfect, scripted answer to all 5 questions to make sure you are fully prepared for your interview.\\n\\nQ1. What didn't you like about your last job? \\nThis is a really difficult interview question to answer because it is assessing your levels of honesty, and your reasons for leaving your last job.\\n\\nQ2. Where do you see yourself in five years?\\nThis is one of the hardest interview questions to answer because, if we’re honest, we don’t know even where you are going to be next year, let alone in 5 years’ time. Having said that, there is a way you need to answer this tough interview question if you are to pass your job interview which I will give to you very soon.\\n\\nQ3. Why should I hire you? \\nThis has always been one of the hardest interview questions to answer because, the truth is, you want a job. But to say you should hire me because I want a job is not going to get you hired. Again, this could be the one interview question that decides whether or not they take you on in the role, so make sure you give a powerful and positive answer that proves you can add value in the position.\\n\\nQ4. What makes you unique?\\nThis is one of the hardest interview questions to answer because the interviewer is using it to determine which candidate is the best person for the job. But what does make a person unique? Well, very soon, I will give you an outstanding answer that is guaranteed to impress the hiring manager.\\n\\nQ5. What is your biggest weakness?\\nThis interview question catches out 95% of candidates!
